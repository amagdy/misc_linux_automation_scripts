# Miscellaneous Linux Automation Scripts
This is a group of scripts that I use to automate a lot of tedious tasks in development or day to day work. These scripts are written in Bash, PHP and Python.

**These scripts cannot be used for production purposes they are just sample scripts that you may use after reading and editing them.**
